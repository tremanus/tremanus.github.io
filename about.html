        <p>My name is Biya Brook and I am the son of Ethiopian immigrants. I was born in Boston, moved to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia when I was 6, and moved back to Boston when I was 8. I recently graduated from Boston Latin School and am currently a freshman at Stanford studying Symbolic Systems.</p>
	<p>I have many years of experience with language starting in high school, tutoring Latin to students afterschool as part of the McCarthy Institute and building ScholaLatinae.com, a nonprofit designed to teach people the Classical world for free. Additionally, I have had 4 years of experience in industry, serving as a Peer Tutor for The Calculus Project for 2 years and a Research Assistant for the Musculoskeletal Informatics Group at Boston Children's Hospital for 2 years.</p>
        <p>My passion for languages brought me to Symbolic Systems, a major at Stanford focusing on the relationship between humans and artificial intelligence. Symbolic Systems integrates the disciplines of Computer Science, Linguistics, Mathematics, Philosophy, Psychology, and Statistics. At Stanford, I hope to use my skill and passion in languages to better humanity. On this website, I will share all of my projects that I work on.</p>
